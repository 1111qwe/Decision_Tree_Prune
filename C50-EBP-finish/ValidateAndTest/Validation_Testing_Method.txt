Validation and Testing Method:

①cd see5-public

②change the following line
String		FileStem="undefined";
to
String		FileStem="crx";

in file global.c

③copy crx.tree(the model of training) crx.names to see5-public/


④prepare validation file or test file

both validation and test file have the same suffix ".cases"
the only difference is:
test file has "?" at  the place of "class"
**********************
For example,
in validation file crx.cases:
a,47.25,0.75,u,g,q,h,2.75,t,t,01,f,g,00333,892,+
in test       file crx.cases:
a,47.25,0.75,u,g,q,h,2.75,t,t,01,f,g,00333,892,?
**********************

copy crx.cases to see5-public/

⑤gcc sample.c -lm

⑥./a.out
