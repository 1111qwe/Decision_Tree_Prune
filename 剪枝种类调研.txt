In the past decades, several post-pruning algorithms have been introduced such as reduced-error pruning, error-complexity pruning, minimum-error pruning, and cost-based pruning. Most of the pruning methods such as reduced-error pruning and minimum-error pruning traverse the decision tree in bottom-up order estimating the misclassification errors for each node to reduce the tree size and to avoid the over-fitting problem.

后剪枝类型:
CBP(cost-based pruning)(Google上面没看到有这个说法,百度有人在提)
-------------------------------------------------
reduced-error pruning,需要单独的验证数据集,REP剪枝的一句是验证集说了算√
error-complexity pruning
EBP(Error Based Pruning)(C4.5)
CCP(cost-complexity pruning)(Cart树-分类-剪枝)√
minimum-error pruning
Pessimistic Error Pruning (PEP，悲观剪枝）,PEP剪枝算法是在C4.5决策树算法中提出的,不需要单独的验证数据集
